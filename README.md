Mobile Application Development Experiments Lab Report

S V AKASH, Roll No: 221501006

Overview: This repository is dedicated to various experiments designed to enhance mobile application development. It includes a range of features that focus on improving security, usability, and user experience. The experiments include functionalities such as secure login systems, font customization, a basic calculator, database connectivity, credential verification, and integration of Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies.

Key Features:

Login System:

Description: The system is designed with an emphasis on security, featuring username and password validation, error handling for incorrect login attempts, and session management to ensure a smooth user experience.
Usage: Users can log in with their credentials, which are verified before granting access to the main application screen.

Font Change Functionality:

Description: Users can dynamically change the font style and size for a more personalized experience.
Usage: In the settings menu, users can choose from a variety of predefined font styles and sizes, with real-time previews available.
Calculator:

Description: A basic arithmetic calculator integrated into the application.
Usage: Users can perform simple mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division directly through the appâ€™s interface.

Database Connectivity:

Description: This module enables the application to connect to a database, perform queries, and store or retrieve data.
Usage: The connection setup involves specifying database parameters like type, server address, and user credentials.

Credential Verification:

Description: An additional security feature that includes email verification, two-factor authentication (2FA), and a password strength checker.
Usage: Users must verify their email after registration, and optionally, they can enable 2FA for added security.

TTS (Text-to-Speech) & STT (Speech-to-Text):

TTS:
Description: Converts written text into audible speech, improving accessibility and user engagement.
Usage: The app reads content aloud, benefiting users with reading difficulties or those who prefer auditory feedback.

STT:
Description: Transcribes spoken language into text, enabling voice commands and hands-free interaction with the application.
Usage: Users can dictate messages, control app features, or transcribe audio in real time.
Implementation Considerations: When integrating TTS and STT, developers must carefully choose the appropriate APIs (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Microsoft Azure Speech), handle errors effectively, and ensure the integration is seamless for a smooth user experience.
